# Facebook-Stream-PHP
<p>This code can fetch the most recent posts on a multiple fan page, or community group, embedding them on your site.<br>
<br>
 For each post retrieved from Facebook, the also gets attached photos, link, along with the like, comment, and share counters.<br>
<br>
 Retrieved photos can be viewed at their natural size using a local modal window, and a link is also provided to view the original posts on Facebook.<br>
<br>
 To use, a Facebook Access Token is needed, but the process is quite simple and won't stop anyone with technical skills in getting it done.</p>
